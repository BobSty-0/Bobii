# Bobii - Discord Bot

I am actively programming on this bot, so if you have any questions, suggestions for improvement or even an idea for a new function, please feel free to write on Discord.

## How does the bot work?

The bot works with slash commands which should be suggested as soon as you write a slash in a text channel.

To start off you can use /helpbobii and the bot will return a message with a selection menu, simply select the section in which you are interested in.

## Support:

If you need support you can simply message Bobii by direct message. I'm able to read the direct messages and respond to them. Another way to get help is to join the official discord server.

## Temp Channels:

These are channels which are created and removed automatically. You can add a create-temp-channel with an already existing voice channel. The temp-voice-channels will be created simply by joining the create-voice-channel. Also, the temp-voice-channel is created in the same category as the create-temp-channel and will overtake the create-temp-channel permissions (If you want to work with private create-temp-channels I suggest to give Bobii advanced permissions like Administrator for example).

Furthermore, you have the option to create also a temp-text-channel which is linked to the temp-voice-channel.

The owner of the temp-channel is able to edit the temp-channel with build in commands.

Note: To manage the created temporary channels you need either Administrator or Manage Server rights.

## Watch 2 Gether:
You can create YouTube watch together events for chosen voice channels!

Note: To create a YouTube watch 2 gether event you need either Administrator or Manage Server rights.

## Filter Words:

These are words that are automatically detected by Bobii. He will delete the original message and compose a new message in which the word to be filtered is replaced by the replace word.

Note: To manage the filter words you need either Administrator or Manage Server rights.

## Filter Link:

Filter link is an option to filter links as the name already says. As soon as you activate filter link Bobii starts blocking all links except the once on the whitelist which you can manage with build in commands. Furthermore, you can add users to the whitelist which won't be affected by filter link.

You can also set up logging to see which message from which user has been blocked.

Note: To manage filter link you need either Administrator or Manage Server rights.

## Text Utility:

Text utility will allow you to create and edit embeds for nice looking announcement's etc.

Note: To create an embed you need either Administrator or Manage Server rights.

You can also steal emoji's from other servers fairly simple with the emoji itself if you have nitro or with the emoji URL. Once you successfully stole the emoji everyone on the server will be able to use them in your server regardless if they have nitro or not ^^.

Note: To steal an emoji you need either Administrator or Manage Server rights.
